JavaScript Object history

## Behind the scenes

For cloning, [UltraDeepClone](https://github.com/imbcmdth/UltraDeepClone). For diff/apply, [changeset](https://github.com/eugeneware/changeset).

## Old browsers

Works in IE8 with `es5-shim`. Perhaps IE7, as well.

## Constructor

{%= apidocs("lib/index.js") %}

## Constructor options

`limit`
  Optional. Provide a number of backwards history points to keep.
  Older than this number will be forgotten and hopefully their allocated memory will be reclaimed.

## Methods

{%= apidocs("lib/prototype/\*") %}

## Copyright

{%= copyright %}
